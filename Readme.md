# Deepview: View Synthesis with Learned Gradient Descent

An unofficial implementation of "Deepview: View Synthesis with Learned Gradient Descent". This repository is modified from another unofficial implementation, so that this version of implementation has fewer python files, is easy to read and gets rid of some unreasonable details of code.

Hope you can enjoy this repo!

(More details about this repo needs to be written down in this readme, thanks for your waiting!)
